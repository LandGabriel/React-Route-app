# 📚 Adventure of Choices | Learning Project with React Router

This is a simple and didactic project created to practice and consolidate fundamental React concepts, with a special focus on **route management** and creating an interactive user experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to serve as a practical foundation for learning React, specifically by using the **React Router DOM** library.

The application simulates a "**Choose Your Own Adventure**" game, where user choices influence the navigation and dynamically update the displayed content.

## ✨ Concepts Practiced

During the development of this project, the following key concepts were applied:

- **Functional Components**  
  Building UI elements using function-based React components.

- **State and Navigation Hooks**  
  - `useState`: Managing component-level state.  
  - `useParams`: Extracting dynamic route parameters.  
  - `useNavigate`: Navigating programmatically between routes.

- **Dynamic Routes**  
  Routes like `/scenario/:scenarioId` reuse the same component with different data.

- **Router Structure**  
  Setting up routing with `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`.

- **Componentization**  
  Separating the UI into reusable components: `HomePage`, `ScenarioPage`, `EndingPage`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** – JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM** – Declarative routing for React apps.
- **Vite** – Fast and modern development build tool.
- **Pure CSS** – Styling using standard CSS (no frameworks), focusing on React logic.
