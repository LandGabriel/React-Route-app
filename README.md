üìö Adventure of Choices | Learning Project with React Router
This is a simple and didactic project created to practice and consolidate fundamental React concepts, with a special focus on route management and creating an interactive user experience.

üéØ Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to serve as a practical foundation for learning React, specifically by using the React Router DOM library. The application simulates a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, where user choices change the navigation and the content displayed on the screen.

‚ú® Concepts Practiced
During the construction of this application, the following topics were exercised:

Functional Components: The use of functions to create React components.

State and Navigation Hooks:

useState: Managing the local state of components.

useParams: Reading dynamic parameters from the URL to load specific data.

useNavigate: Programmatic navigation between the application's routes.

Dynamic Routes: Creating flexible routes, such as /scenario/:scenarioId, to reuse the same component with different data.

Router Structure: Configuring BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route to define the navigation architecture.

Componentization: Dividing the interface into reusable components (HomePage, ScenarioPage, EndingPage).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: The standard library for declarative routing in React.

Vite: A modern and fast build tool.

Pure CSS: Styling without third-party libraries to focus on React logic.
